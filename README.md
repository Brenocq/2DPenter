# 2D Penter
_by Breno Queiroz and Dikson Ferreira_
## Introduction
This printer is designed to draw polynomial functions from a string. When connecting to the wifi network created by ESP32, it is possible to make the printer go home, move the axes, draw a point on paper, or send the polynomial function string to draw the graphic.
